# If you have a Draft genome with many fragments (hundreds or thousands!),
# you can simulated them as bands. The first row have the directions to 
# draw the ideogram and the others identified the bands. 
# Circos only recognizes “chr” or “band”. Then, we need to specify an ID, 
# level, start-end and color.

# Save this into a .txt file, like: bacteria_genome_karyotype.txt
